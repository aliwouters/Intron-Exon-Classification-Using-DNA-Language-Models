# Intron-Exon-Classification-Using-DNA-Language-Models
This project focused on identifying intron and exon regions within genomic DNA sequences. Using labeled nucleotide sequences, the task was framed as a binary classification problem where each base was assigned a label indicating whether it belonged to an exon (1) or intron (0). The approach incorporated advanced DNA language models to extract contextual embeddings from raw sequences. Model experimentation included traditional classifiers and modern transformer-based architectures capable of processing long-range dependencies. Final predictions were evaluated on Codabench for nucleotide-level accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of language modeling in genomic sequence analysis.
